  # Shadowkin

  Shadowkin are a mysterious race of psionic aliens of extradimensional origin.

  They natively speak the Marish language.

  ## Positive Traits
  -[color=#1e90ff]Barrel Chested[/color]:
  Shadowkin, as a result of living in a dimension where there is little air, do not have lungs but instead a core. Their core allows them to more efficiently process oxygen and not use as much as a result.

  -[color=#1e90ff]Innate Telepathy[/color]:
  Shadowkin are innately telepathic, allowing them to communicate with other psionic individuals at will.

  -[color=#1e90ff]Psionic Species[/color]:
  Shadowkin as a species inhabit a unique ability to more easily learn new psionic abilities, in part owing to their home dimension being incredibly hostile to those who would be considered "normal".

  -[color=#1e90ff]Resting[/color]:
  Shadowkin are able to fall into a deep and powerful sleep to quickly recover mana to use their psionic abilities sooner than others.

  ## Negative Traits
  -[color=#ffa500]Glass Cannon[/color]:
  Shadowkin are very vulnerable to damage from an array of sources, preferring speed and agility over direct combat.

  -[color=#ffa500]Easy Target[/color]:
  Due to the fact they're inherently psionic, they make for easy targets by over-eager epistemics staff... and any other beasts that lurk in the dark.

  -[color=#ffa500]Unfortunate Evolution[/color]:
  Most Shadowkin are not very tall, rendering them easy to pick up and throw around. As a result, space wind hits them 20% harder and their bones are not very durable either.
