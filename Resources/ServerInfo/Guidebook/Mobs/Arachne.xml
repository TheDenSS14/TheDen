  Arachne are a race whose upper body resembles a humanoid's, while their lower body resembles a gigantic spider.

  ## Diet

  - They are innate bloodfeeders, and derive thirst, nourishment, and health restoration from drinking blood of any kind (except their own).

  ## Benefits
  - They cannot be slipped.
  - They move faster compared to a human.
  - They take less damage from barotrauma (extreme pressure differences).
  - They can control their movement in zero-gravity environments.

  ## Special
  - Capable of spinning silk, producing webs, and wrapping victims in cocoons. They can also suck the blood out of a cocooned victim.

  ## Drawbacks
  - Their demonic blood is quenching and slightly alcoholic, but regenerating it causes rapid dehydration. It cannot be restored by iron.
  - They cannot wear shoes or full-body protective gear, such as hardsuits.
