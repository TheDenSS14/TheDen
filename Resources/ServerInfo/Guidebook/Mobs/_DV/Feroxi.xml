  The Feroxi (fer-ox-i) are a race of humanoid shark-like beings. Carnivourous in nature with a strong bite force.

  They natively speak the NÄ“hina language.

  ## Diet

  - Can ONLY eat meat.
  - Will get poisoned by Theobromine (Chocolate, Tea, Coffee) and Allicin (Onion, Garlic).

  ## Benefits

  - Uses their jaws to do piercing damage, and harder than other species, rivaling Oni.
  - Their cartilaginous skeleton allows them to resist blunt force trauma more easily.
  - Their adaptation to native environments allows them to resist the cold more easily.
  - Their biology allow them to breathe water vapour.

  ## Drawbacks

  - They take 10% more Slash damage.
  - Gets thirsty 100% faster. That's faster than a Diona!
  - When thirst falls to "Parched" they begin to suffocate. Have water handy!
  - Saline is too salty! It hydrates you much less!
  - Your lungs are unremovable as theyre intergrated with your gills.
