  An industrious hymenoptera species, the Chitinid are strong and diligent. Thanks to evolution, they have grown an acute resistance to radiation, but not without its side effects.

  They natively speak the Chittin language.

  ## Diet
  - Can eat raw meat.

  ## Benefits
  - Takes 80% less Radiation, 10% less Slash Blunt and Piercing.
  - Their bodies naturally recover from light radiation damage up to a point, once they accumulate enough radiation they must purge it from their systems in the form of a small rock [color=#ff0f0f]WARNING:The Chitzite they expel is slightly radioactive [/color].
  - They are Better at pulling and carrying things.
  - They possess a bio light.

  ## Drawbacks
  - They take 15% more Shock damage due to their biology.
  - Due to their hard shells normal syringes can not pierce them, requiring hypos to bypass the toughness.
  - Thanks to their overactive systems they get hungry 33% faster.
  - The cold does not agree with their biology and makes their movement sluggish the colder it gets, the cold also harms them more than others causing them to take 25% more damage from it.
  - They are deceptively heavy due to their lifestyle and diet.
  - Bug Blood.
