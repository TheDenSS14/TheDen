  Large, horned people that come in a variety of colors. Their accuracy with guns is terrible, but their physical strength brings them a lot of boons both in and out of combat.

  ## Upsides
  -35% Blunt melee damage increase, 25% increase for other brute types (can be changed with traits)
  -15 extra stamina and increased stamina regeneration
  -Higher base mass
  -Unique traitor item: the kanabou
