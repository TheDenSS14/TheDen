# these are HEAVILY based on the Bingle free-agent ghostrole from GoobStation, but reflavored and reprogrammed to make them more Robust (and less of a meme.)
# all credit for the core gameplay concepts and a lot of the core functionality of the code goes to the folks over at Goob, but I re-wrote enough of it to justify putting it in our filestructure.
# the original Bingle PR can be found here: https://github.com/Goob-Station/Goob-Station/pull/1519
