humanoid-profile-editor-employer-label = Employer

character-employer-requirement = You must{$inverted ->
    [true]{" "}not
    *[other]{""}
} be employed by one of these: {$employers}

employer_name_nanotrasen = NanoTrasen
employer_description_nanotrasen = The economic engine of the Republic of Biesel and the galaxy’s foremost leader in phoron research. With near-total control over Biesel’s economy and infrastructure, NanoTrasen presents itself as a champion of progress and prosperity—though critics argue it values profit above all else.

employer_name_unemployed = Unemployed
employer_description_unemployed = Whether down on their luck or simply unwilling to work, the unemployed survive however they can. Some live off government subsidies, others turn to freelance work—or less legal alternatives. Either way, society tends to look down on them.

employer_name_hephaestusindustries = Hephaestus Industries
employer_description_hephaestusindustries = A sprawling manufacturing conglomerate responsible for producing everything from mining drills to military hardware. If it has moving parts, Hephaestus probably made it. Known for their no-nonsense corporate culture and deep ties to industrial and frontier colonies.

employer_name_einsteinengines = Einstein Engines
employer_description_einsteinengines = The galaxy’s premier manufacturer of FTL drives and starship technology. Despite their technical prowess, the company is infamous for harsh working conditions, cutthroat internal politics, and an aggressive legal department that makes their lawsuits as feared as their patents.

employer_name_zenghupharmaceuticals = Zeng-Hu Pharmaceuticals
employer_description_zenghupharmaceuticals = The leading name in biotechnology, cybernetics, and pharmaceuticals. Their cutting-edge medical treatments and cybernetic implants have saved countless lives, but their ethics are often called into question—especially by those who can't afford their exorbitant prices.

employer_name_cybersun = Cybersun
employer_description_cybersun = The public face of the Solarian military-industrial complex and one of the most influential defence contractors in known space. From cutting-edge weapons to next-generation warships, Cybersun supplies the Alliance with the tools of war, securing its dominance in the stars. To Solarians, they are patriots and protectors—outsiders, however, may see something far more sinister.

employer_name_interdyne = Interdyne
employer_description_interdyne = A leading name in Solarian biomedical research, cybernetics, and pharmaceutical development. Unlike its competitor Zeng-Hu, Interdyne takes a more pragmatic approach, prioritising efficiency and durability over elegance. Its advanced medical implants and combat-grade augmentations are standard issue in the Solarian military, making it the go-to choice for those who expect to take a beating—and keep fighting.

employer_name_donkco = Donk Co
employer_description_donkco = From a humble lunch wagon in Nova Scotia, the popularity of the Donk Pocket among coal miners paved the way for Donk's expansion. Now serving as Canada's largest business, Donk co exists as a sprawling mega corporation whose quick and ready-to-eat Donk Pockets come in a variety of flavours. Boasting the best PR department and one of the largest logistics fleets in the galaxy, it's a wonder why Donk co has agreed to Nanotrasen's harsh corporate contract.

employer_name_bishopcybernetics = Bishop Cybernetics
employer_name_description = Bishop's focus is on high-class, stylish cybernetics. A favorite among transhumanists, Bishop manufactures not only prostheses but also brain augmentation, synthetic organ replacements, and odds and ends like implanted wrist-watches. Their business model tends towards smaller, boutique operations, giving it a reputation for high price and luxury.

employer_name_fivepointsarmory = Five Points Armoury
employer_description_fivepointsarmory = Founded by Colonel "Five-Fingers" Devland of the old Five Points Correctional Facility while the site was being decommissioned in the late 2020s. In the present day, Five Points provides the bulk of security equipment for all of NT's installations and to many civilian police and security forces on Earth and abroad.

employer_name_hawkmoonacquisitions = Hawkmoon Acquisitions
employer_description_hawkmoonacquisitions = Having only been founded in the last decade, Hawkmoon Acquisitions is a small, up-and-coming logistics company in the Orion Sector. Specializing in expensive but discreet private courier services, while relatively unknown at large, they remain decently well respected. Particularly among more... unsavory yet well-to-do clientele.

employer_name_discountdans = Discount Dan's
employer_description_discountdans = A liquidation wholesaler. Following the acquisition of a bankrupt chemical supply house's experimental inventory, Discount Dans was able to produce a shelf-stable self-heating form of packaging for his famous soups. These became beloved by freighter crews, and are credited with saving many stranded space explorers from certain hypothermia. Discount Dan's has long-standing contracts with NanoTrasen and many other shipping and industrial clients.
