text-quest-cryptic = Many moonpassings ago, this land was filled with stargazing life. Unfortunately, they were short-sighted and came to ruin under the claws of the Twelve Destructions, several of which still remain on this world.

      I request your assistance with bringing an end to one of them called the Necromancer and repairing the damage their sorcery has caused.

      As wergild for this hunt, I will grant you the knowledge and usage of my Talon. A mightier claw would be rare indeed.

      To forge a new Talon, you will need:
      · A haft carved from the branch of the tree of the light of the sun of the night. I can feel the presence of one such arbor nearby, sickened by unnatural curses. End its suffering so another may bloom.
      · An edge of hardest adamant. All the great forges necessary for the craft were ruined by the Destructions, but they may be repaired. After obtaining an adamantine ingot, craft the blade upon the mystic anvil.
      · A binding of purest green beryl. Fortunately for us both, this one is simplest. Slay the Necromancer and claim it from their corpse.

      With these three crafts in your grasp, place the binding on the haft, and then the edge. Do not become blinded by the strength of the glaive, for it will still be incomplete.

      Return to me then, and obtain my blessing. Infuse it into the binding, and you will finally have a weapon worthy of your accomplishment.

      Good hunting, starsailor.
