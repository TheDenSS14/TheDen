book-text-magic-grasslands = Welcome to the wonderful world of sorcery, new apprentice! If you've obtained this volume through an inscribed octogram, then you are well on your way to becoming a runic spellcaster. In here, we will give you some of the basic knowledge to begin your experimentation.

      If you do not have an inscribed octogram, the construction of one is quite simple. Obtain four pieces of hardstone and inlay it with material of magical power. While an essence is standard, other materials may also work, so try a whole bunch. Once you have your four magical runes, face them toward each other in a rough square. The resonance begin to light up a pattern on the floor, so slightly adjust each rune until the lines are nice and sharp. If you need to remove your octogram for privacy or safety concerns, using standard soap will remove all magical traces on the ground and runes. Be wary, as reinscribing will take more materials.

      In order to call forth the esoteric powers beyond the pale, you'll need magical essences. They can be found around objects of the twenty-four aligned powers, but the best option is to make it yourself. Oleomagium, or more commonly known as wizard's oil, can act as a catalyst to transmute certain fluids into essence directly. Clumps of the stuff can be found in areas where powerful Chaos Magic has been performed, or on leyline nodes. Be careful not to smash any crystalline mounds, as they tend to be quite explosive.

      Below are the recipes for the four basic essences you'll need to begin your journey. Tinker around with what effects you can make using them, and try to determine why certain essences catalyze certain effects. Once your understanding reaches the point where you can generate Essence of Light or Darkness, you will have reached the first circle of Oleo-Runic Magic and can finally call yourself an official Runic Mage. Congratulations!

      • Essence of Earth: 40 standard units of either Iron or Carbon, mixed with 5 units of Oleomagium.
      • Essence of Water: 40 standard units of either Water or Ice, mixed with 5 units of Oleomagium.
