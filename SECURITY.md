# Reporting a security vulnerability

You can report a security vulnerability through Discord or through email.

If you want to send an email, you can contact us at <simplestation@simplestation.org>.
If you want to contact us through Discord, you can join [our server](https://discord.gg/X4QEXxUrsJ) and then **privately** message anyone with the `@Maintainer` role.

In either case, **do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we explicitly give you permission to do so**.
